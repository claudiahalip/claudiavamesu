                Hello! I'm Claudia! I'm a full-stack web developer, welcome to my page!
              </p>

              <p className="story">
              I live in the Chicago suburbs. I recently graduated from Flatiron school, currently working on my own projects where I can practice my skills gained during my time there.
              I’ve graduated from college many years ago with a bachelor’s degree in Public Administration
              but I’ve always known that I wanted to work in tech. This year I decided to change my career...
              Before this change I worked as a photographer. I started as a photojournalist for a local newspaper. Through photography I traveled the world, worked on cruise ships, and met many interesting people.
              Years later, my husband and I created H Photography, our own business which operates in Europe and USA.
              When I'm not coding or photographing I like to play guitar, I'm teaching myself to play piano, I read, and also spend time with my family.
              I am looking for opportunities where I can improve my knowledge and grow in this big and fascinating field of technology.
