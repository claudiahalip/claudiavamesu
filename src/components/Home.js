              Hi, my name is Claudia and I leave in Chicago, suburbs.I recently finished Flatiron school, currently working on my own projects where I  can practice my skills gained during my time at Flatiron.
I am originally from Romania. I’ve graduate from collage many years ago  with a bachelor’s degree  in Public Administration,
but I’ve always known I wanted to work in tech and this year I’ve decided to change my career.

I am looking for opportunities    where I can improve my knowledges and grow in this big  and fascinated field.
